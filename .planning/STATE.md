# Project State

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-28
**Current Focus**: Project initialization and planning
**Overall Status**: 🟢 On track

## Active Work
- [x] GSD project initialization
- [x] Git re-initialized (clean history)
- [x] GitHub repo creation (`interviewmate-ai`, public)
- [x] Initial commit pushed to `main`

## Recent Decisions
- 2026-02-28: User requested a 2D lightweight avatar (Lottie/SVG) instead of 3D.
- 2026-02-28: Reordered roadmap to tackle Avatar (Phase 3) and Voice (Phase 4) earlier to derisk complex features.
- 2026-02-28: Updated CV flow to support two modes: Recruiter scheduled (pre-loaded CV) and Candidate auto-upload (generic link).
- 2026-02-28: Chose comprehensive depth (10 phases) with standard budget tier
- 2026-02-28: Added interactive voice + graphical virtual assistant as core features (not in original PRD)
- 2026-02-28: Re-initialized git to remove unrelated commit history
- 2026-02-28: Solo developer — sequential execution preferred

## Blockers
- None

## Budget Status
- **Time spent**: ~1 hour (planning/init)
- **Time budget**: ~116-140 hours total
- **Money spent**: $0
- **Status**: 🟢 Under budget

## Next Steps
1. Create GitHub repo and push initial commit
2. Begin Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Design System

## Session Memory
- User wants interactive speaking with graphical virtual assistant — avatar that lip-syncs and shows emotions during interview
- Decided on 2D lightweight avatar (Lottie/SVG) to ensure fast load times and performance.
- Avatar and interactive voice development are prioritized as early phases (Phases 3 and 4) to prove out the core experience quickly.
- CV Upload has dual modes: Recruiter pre-provides CV for scheduled links, OR candidate uploads CV on a generic application link.
- OpenAI Realtime API selected for bidirectional voice
- User has Supabase and OpenAI accounts ready
